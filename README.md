# FAQIAM

- How much memory did I need to use more of the original variables that I eventually did
- Is GLM the right regression for this?
- Why was the orignal data so inconsistent about the details of the same intersection
- Is the month really the most impactful variable?
- Why didn't they mention the make/model of the car involved?
